The p2p University is a succcesor of the p2pu project it implements the working core principles on top of top notch tech as also Implements many levels for more professional education partners like existing universitys they are invited to adopt this system and curiculums for free (The Unlicense) and they are encurage for the Educational Leader Program where we Offer Sessions with Leaders in the specific filds to offer High Value Education for education professionals to build a pipeline of knowleg that can flow fast to every one via every other community implementations or place

## Why?
The p2pu effort was inspiring for me and it was one of my first contacts with the Mozilla Org its philosophie and so on. But Mozilla suffers from the same issues that all coders did suffer from there is simply to much and there are to many ways. So i invested simply over 20 years into my Own Knowleg and Education about Fundamental topics like building states and universitys as also communitys. 

This effort has a priority for me because i need to establish a foundation for my Kids and his frinds too. And as always i invite everyone to join my effort. 

## Forbiden Knowleg?
Yes i also want to host forbidden knowleg as the concept of that does not exist for me i speak truth and that no one wants to hear that is total human and logical but that makes it not less needed! So i designed P2P-university around my Internet Of People Web 4.0 Concepts as also the @stealify https://github.com/stealify component system. That leads to that fact that communitys and learning circles Established via this Concepts and methods are resilient to factors like World War or other large scale impacts the concepts also should at the core enable you to reestablish local states. This is designed for the most bad scenario that could and will happen according to murphys law “Anything that can go wrong will go wrong.”
